# Adding-a-PersonName-Data-Type-to-PostgreSQL

## Project Overview

This project involves extending PostgreSQL by adding a new data type for dealing with people's names. The goal is to explore how we store and manipulate names as a separate base data type, rather than just text strings.

## Problem Definition

The problem is to define a new base data type in PostgreSQL that can handle people's names in the format `FamilyName,GivenNames`. This involves understanding the PostgreSQL extensibility model, defining the new data type, and implementing the necessary functions and operators for this data type.

## Output Format

The output of this project will be a new data type in PostgreSQL that can handle people's names. This will involve creating new SQL commands for creating and manipulating this new data type, and possibly new operators for comparing and sorting names.

## Code Execution

The code for this project will be written in C, as this is the language used for extending PostgreSQL. The code will need to be compiled and linked into the PostgreSQL server. The new data type will then be available for use in SQL commands.
